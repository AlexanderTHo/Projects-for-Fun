# Projects for Fun

Welcome to my portfolio of projects done during my free time since post-graduate school. This repository showcases a variety of projects focused on Machine Learning, Data Science as well as some hardware devices.

As I continue to grow, I will add more projects and files to demonstrate my passion for the field.

The time between projects and adding projects to this repository will vary based on the cleanliness of the code and ability to complete while searching for a full-time position and working part-time.

UPDATE: The addition to this repository has taken a halt due to the pursuit and study of AWS Certifications. The current certification goal is AWS practiooner.
